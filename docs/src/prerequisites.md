# Prerequisites

This course will not teach you machine learning nor will it teach you how to
program. Therefore, the more you know on the below topics, the less confused you
will be and the more you will gain from the course.

- **Math**: linear algebra, in particular matrix multiplication, number systems
  including binary counting, functions
- **Computing**: computer architecture, two's complement, boolean algebra,
  memory, bit manipulation
- **Programming**: conditionals and control flow, loops, variables, data types,
  compilation and linking, logical operators
- **Electronics**: voltage and current, logic gates, transistors, circuits
- **Machine learning**: feed-forward fully connected networks, convolutional
  networks, backpropagation, gradient descent, weights, activation functions,
  cost functions
- **Software**: command line familiarity, basic operating systems knowledge, Git

No machine learning or SystemVerilog knowledge is required, learning material
will be provided.

For getting to speed with SystemVerilog, I recommend:

- [This excellent primer by DJ Greaves from the Cambridge University CS dept](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~djg11/teaching/learners.pdf).
- [This more thorough slide set from Dan Gisselquist over at ZipCPU](https://zipcpu.com/tutorial/).
